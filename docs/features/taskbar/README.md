# Taskbar

The taskbar serves as a hub for access to various other functionalites, mainly applications. It's very similar to Window's taskbar.

The taskbar can be split up into 3 main segments:

- Menus - This includes the home menu, where you can find quick access and a list of applications and the search menu, where you can search for applications by name.

- Apps list - This is a list of pinned applications, similar to how Window's taskbar pinning works.

- Indicators - This is a group of indicators that are used to display information, like battery power, network connection and volume.
