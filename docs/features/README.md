# Features

Most code for features can be found in the [features](../../src/features) directory. This directory is a library that is mostly used by files in the [components](../../src/components) and [hooks](../../src/hooks) directory.

> Note: Inside this part of the docs you will often see mentions of directories like `features` or `components`. These paths are relative to the `src` directory. The respective paths relative to the root of this project are `src/features` and `src/components`.

To see the status and to-do's of each feature, check the [task board](https://prozilla.notion.site/8325fabca1fb4f9885b6d6dfd5aa64c8?v=1a59f7ce50914f5ea711fe6460e52868&pvs=4) on Notion.
